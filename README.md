# Fresh Start
A custom build of the [_s](https://github.com/automattic/_s) WordPress starter theme.

## Why use _s?
- Because it is created by the same people that manage WordPress, so the base theme already adheres to the Theme Review guidelines and agreed upon best practices.
- It is regularly updated in parallel with WordPress core.
- It keeps the custom functionality to a minimum, leaving it up to you to add it.

## But it ships with a bunch of shit I don't need
Yes, it does. You are meant to really examine the code, understand what it is doing, and hack it to fit your needs. If you are too lazy to do that, then this theme is not meant for you.

As the default `_s` is meant to be a very broad starting point, I have already stripped it down to what I need it to be.

### TODO:
- swap out current gallery css for flexbox
- write some basic theme options via the customizer
- add px to em conversion mixin
- add px to rem conversion mixin
- add color function
- add breakpoint mixin
