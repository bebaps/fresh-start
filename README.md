# Fresh Start WordPress Starter Theme

I created this for my own personal use. If you happen to find value in it and want to use it yourself, awesome.

This theme assumes this is not your first time building a WordPress theme, and that you are familiar with modern development tooling and technologies.

This new version of Fresh Start has moved away from using [_s](https://github.com/automattic/_s) as its base and moved to [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/) and its [starter theme](https://github.com/timber/starter-theme). Underscores was and is great for people just starting out, but its pretty outdated as far as modern practices and tools go, and the move to something like Timber or [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) is natural.

I choose to use Timber over Sage simply because it leaves the workflow entirely up to you.
